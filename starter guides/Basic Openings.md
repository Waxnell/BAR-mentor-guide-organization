# Starting Positions and the Basic Opening

Openings in BAR vary based on map, factory choice, current wind speed, and team size. Generally, you want to build as many metal extractors close to your commander as possible, build enough energy structures so you don't run out completely, then build your factory of choice.

## Selecting a Start Position

#### Most matches allow you to select your starting position within a set area.

###### Click anywhere in the green rectangle at the start of a match to set your commander to spawn there.[^1]
###### Look for clusters of metal spots that will allow you to place metal extractors quickly, and try to start close to the center of a cluster while still in range to build a metal extractor as soon as you spawn. 
###### Your build range is indicated by the circle around your commander.

### What makes a good start position?

###### Most maps have small clusters of 3 metal spots arranged in the start box, marking clear options for players to choose from or for teammates to distribute among themselves.

###### Some maps may have only pairs of metal spots available, or no clusters at all. Look at the number on the metal spot carefully, and look for starting positions with pairs of higher value metal spots - or even solitary high-value metal spots (e.g. 4.0+). These can be powerful starting positions as well. 

## Basic Openings

#### The below two factories make up the majority of openings:

- **Bot factory**
    - >*bots are cheaper, heavier on energy cost, perform better on sloped terrain and turn quickly*
      
- **Vehicle factory**
    - > *vehicles are expensive, heavier on metal cost, perform better on flat terrain and turn slowly*

#### Other factories will be covered in depth in other guides:

- **Air factory**
    - > *specific to air, possible start option in team games, usually bootstrapped with a bot factory opening*
- **Hovercraft factory**
    - > *specific to land + sea maps, usually bootstrapped with a bot factory opening*
- **Shipyard**
    - > *specific to sea maps or sea lanes in team games*

The following starter build is not always the most efficient - this is dependent on wind speed and how well you can manage energy in the first minute of the game. This opening focuses on consistency and ease of use.

### Steps

##### (Assuming 3 metal extractor spots)[^2]

1. **Build 2 metal extractors**[^3]

2. **Build 1 solar collector**[^4]

3. **Build 1 metal extractor**

4. **Build 1 solar collector**
  
5. **Build Bot OR Vehicle Factory**
    
6. **Build more wind generators / solar panels as needed with the commander and start producing a constructor**
    - > *The Commander/Constructor can be used to assist the factory (right click the factory with the commander) to produce from it faster, but it's important to have enough resources or the assisting won't help*
    
7. **Build ~2 scouts for base defense and another constructor**
    - > *Having more constructors allows you to assist the factory for faster unit production and/or build up more resource income*
    
8. **Build a radar**
    - > *Enemies show up on radar as dots, this is important so you can respond to threats*
    
9. **From here you have options:**
    - > *Make sure you have enough units to defend the base, or build a Guard / Sentry tower as protection*
    - > *Build more constructors to add on more wind turbines / solar, claim more metal spots and assist your factory[^5]*
    - > *Move units out to help secure the front, defend against possible leaks and apply pressure to your opponent(s)*

10. **Importantly, get your commander to the frontline** *(unless you're playing as a backline techer)*
    - > *Feel free to grab some more mex along the way*
    - > *This is important to help secure the frontline in order to secure the area behind the front - the sooner you move out, the more potential land you can secure*
    - > *Feel free to skip some of the mex as your commander moves if you're trying to get to the front faster. You can always claim those with constructors too*

#### More detailed builds will be explained in other guides!

[^1]: In duel / FFA modes, the game will choose a starting location for you instead of using start boxes

[^2]: Metal Extractors are usually referred to as mex

[^3]: The commander has some passive energy generation, so if the walking distance to the 3rd mex lets you get enough energy so you don't stall, reordering to 3mex 2solar 1lab is great too. Later on, once you can make snap judgment calls about where wind speed is likely to remain for the next while, you can go for riskier openings and replace the solars with wind when the conditions are right.

[^4]: Wind generators are preferred for maps with good wind, especially if the wind is high at the time. You can view the current wind speed at the top right windmill icon. Mouse over the icon to see the average wind speed. The small numbers denote minimum and maximum wind speed. If the current wind speed is 8 or higher, building 2 wind generators instead of each solar collector may be more efficient. Note, some maps don't have wind at all, while others have a ton of wind power.

[^5]: It is more efficient to assist 1 factory than to build multiple factories
