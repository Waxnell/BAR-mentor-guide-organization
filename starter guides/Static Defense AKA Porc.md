Porc - short for porcupine - is another name for static defense, a.k.a turrets or towers. These are capable of shaping the flow of the game very early on, strengthening a forward position or securing your flanks from attacks. They  present an obstacle for your opponent to deal with.

##Pros and Cons

In general, static defenses come with certain pros and cons compared to combat units.

Pros:
- Good range, typically higher than most units in their tier
- Cost-efficient, dealing more damage than most units of their cost in their tier

Cons:
- Immobile, unable to aid in attacking an enemy base, press an advantage, pursue fleeing units, or attack units that go around
- Vulnerable to artillery, which outranges most static defense
- Must be built on the frontline, requiring buildpower

These qualities push static defenses into particular roles, varying somewhat depending on the particular structure. Porc works best when supported by your units, which can provide vision, respond to enemy attacks, and strike at enemy artillery.

##Roles

###Works well as

- Base protection - build one or two LLTs in your base to stop enemy raiders from destroying fragile structures. You may want to build light defenses around your metal extractors as well, especially if they are spread out or vulnerable.
- Holding the frontline - build some structures on the frontline for your units to retreat into *and* to deflect pushes from opponent's units, giving you space.

###Works poorly as

- Spam - investing too much into static defense leaves you vulnerable to artillery (which porc cannot retreat from) or a flank attack (circumventing your defenses or focusing on where they're weakest)
- Widespread defense - enemies can concentrate their forces on one location, so you need mobile units to respond to them

## Breakdown

Each defensive structure has particular strengths and weaknesses.

### T1

#### Sentry / Guard

Also known as LLT, this is the cheapest defensive structure. It is well-rounded and ideal as your primary defense building in the early game, but needs support to work best. 

Pros:
- Commander can build it, so it's easy to get on the front lines very early
- Inexpensive, so losing it to artillery doesn't hurt that much
- Multiple spaced out LLTs firing on a unit get a small bonus due to flanking

Cons:
- Low range, outranged by even rocket bots
- Low health
- Laser weapons deal reduced damage at distance (50% at maximum range)

#### Beamer

An Armada exclusive laser tower, this is a step up from the LLT, featuring increased range and a consistent stream of increased damage. Effective vs rocket bots.

Pros:
- Outranges rocket bots
- Outranges LLT, can zone out LLTs
- Very effective vs light units (e.g. ticks) due to no overkill

Cons:
- Armada exclusive
- Gains no bonus to damage from veterancy
- Laser weapons deal reduced damage at distance (50% at maximum range)

#### Twin Guard

Also known as DLLT, this is a Cortex exclusive dual laser tower. It is a step up from the LLT, featuring much higher DPS and health.

Pros:
- Top portion outranges rocket bots
- Top portion outranges LLT, can zone out LLTs
- Extremely effective vs light units due to its increased damage and HP

Cons:
- Cortex exclusive
- Two LLTs can cover more distance
- Bottom portion has same range as LLT, significantly reducing its effectiveness against rocket bots
- Laser weapons deal reduced damage at distance (50% at maximum range)

#### Overwatch / Warden

Also known as HLT, this is an expensive long range laser tower that can ward off units from a chokepoint, provided you keep it supported. The consistent ranged damage prevents a significant obstacle to bot players, but vehicle players have no problems dealing with it.

Pros:
- Excellent range, outranging even missile trucks
- Zones out LLTs and snipes rezbots from supporting pushes
- Very hard to dislodge in a chokepoint

Cons:
- Weak to swarms if unsupported
- Outranged by vehicle artillery
- Weapon range exceeds vision range, requiring scouts or radar for vision. Misses often against radar dots.
- Expensive
- Laser weapons deal reduced damage at distance (50% at maximum range)

#### Dragon's Claw / Dragon's Maw

Also known as popups, these defenses look like walls to the enemy until they get in range, at which point the turret pops up to strike. While closed, they take reduced damage and appear as walls on radar.

Pros:
- Good range, outranging most T1 units and defenses
- Zones out most T1 units and turrets
- Low buildpower cost, meaning they take less time to build
- Very resistant to artillery due to armor while closed and being hard to target with fight-move.
- Repairing them while under attack is very effective
- High DPS
- Some AoE damage
- Can be shielded by T1 walls

Cons:
- Outranged by artillery and missile trucks
- Expensive
- Low range for its price


#### Harpoon / Urchin Offshore Torpedo Launcher

The basic naval static defense, it does an okay job against ships but is invaluable against submarines.

Pros:
- In the commander build options
- Relatively cheap compared to most naval units
- Some AoE damage
- Can hit underwater units with built-in sonar, including submarines and commanders

Cons:
- Outranged by destroyers, which are common in sea battles
- Submarine outranges its sonar range (a submarine with vision support can kill a torpedo launcher with no sonar support)
- Low range. Sea tends to be wide, unless you're in a river, so these can be circumvented easily and need support from shark's teeth
- Cannot hit hover units

#### Anemone / Jellyfish Coastal Torpedo launcher

A powerful land-to-sea torpedo launcher. It can help secure rivers from attack or gain a foothold in the sea.

Pros:
- High range, outranged only by destroyers
- Great sight and sonar range
- Immune to torpedos

Cons:
- Expensive
- Can only build on land

#### Gauntlet / Agitator Medium Plasma Artillery

An offense and zoning tool, **NOT** a defense tool. These effectively deny area from your opponent, eliminating enemy defenses and units that stand in its long range. Consider whether it would be more effective to build 6 more tanks, a different factory, or T2 instead. Never build more than one.

Pros:
- Highest range in T1
- High trajectory mode can shoot over obstacles
- Zones out all enemy turrets, denies reclaim to the opponent by sniping rezbots

Cons:
- **EXTREMELY** expensive
- Very long build time
- Requires a lot of support to keep it safe - it is a high priority target for the enemy, and leaves a valuable wreck if destroyed.
- Long reload time severely limits its short term damage over time potential
- Requires great placement near the frontline and denying enemy mexes to maximize value
- Obsoleted by T2 popup artillery

### Thistle / Nettle

The basic T1 anti-air tower, you usually won't need much more than this unless the enemy air is getting very aggressive. Building 2 or 3 spaced out makes for a solid air defense.

Pros:
- Cheap
- Quick to build

Cons:
- Very fragile

### Ferret / SAM

A step up from basic T1 anti-air, these defenses are limited by their short range. They're excellent at deterring T1 gunships.

Pros:
- High DPS
- Very high HP, will not die to stray bomblets or gunships

Cons:
- Expensive, so you can't build as many
- Low range means less coverage

### Chainsaw / Eradicator

Basically considered T1.5 AA, this is an excellent deterrent against an eager air player. On smaller maps or maps with clustered bases, this can replace a forest of Nettles or zone out gunships.

Pros:
- Very good range, even significantly outranging T2 flak
- High DPS
- Very high HP

Cons:
- Expensive
- Very little AoE damage

#### Jammer / radar

While not strictly defensive structures, these can amplify your porc in a number of ways.

- Radar gives your supporting units intel to react to enemy pushes
- Radars have high line-of-sight, which can counteract jamming and provide vision for longer-ranged defenses
- Jammers deny radar vision from your opponent, hiding your porc from artillery and forcing them to use line-of-sight for targeting. They also hide the true strength (or lack thereof) of your forces
- These are vulnerable to the Juno, which kills them in one hit from any range

### T2

#### Scorpion / Pitbull

The LLT equivalent in T2, these defenses feature surprisingly high damage and range, denying enemy pushes for a relatively low cost.\

Pros:
- Very good DPS for its cost
- Deals full damage even at maximum range
- Outranges hounds
- Very potent against assault units, especially slower ones
- Takes reduced damage while closed
- Can be shielded by T1 walls

Cons:
- Artillery is very common in T2, and outranges them (except for hound)
- High cost for a static unit without excellent range

#### Rattlesnake / Persecutor Pop-up Plasma Artillery

A very potent defensive structure, this can keep a large area suppressed with a steady barrage of long range, high AoE plasma. Its improved range and damage makes it a very significant upgrade from the T1 plasma artillery

Pros:
- Outranges all T2 units
- Takes reduced damage while closed. Combined with its high HP, it is hard to kill.
- Increased range if on higher ground

Cons:
- Expensive
- Requires good placement
- Requires vision / radar support to reach its full potential. Jamming counters radar.


#### Pulsar

The pinnacle of Armada's defense, this weapon eliminates armored targets with deadly precision. It is even effective against T3 units.

Pros:
- Highest range defense
- Extremely high, instantaneous burst damage
- Built-in radar (can't be juno'd)
- Good vision range
- High HP, and takes reduced damage while closed

Cons:
- Laser weapons deal reduced damage at distance (50% at maximum range)
- Extremely expensive
- Requires energy to fire
- Must be closed manually to protect from artillery
- Prime target for tactical missiles

#### Bulwark

The pinnacle of Cortex's defense, this weapon decimates swarms with great efficiency. Its range limits its usefulness.

Pros:
- Very high DPS
- Multiple weapon types to counter swarms
- Built-in radar (can't be juno'd)
- Outranges T2 artillery and sharpshooters
- High HP, and takes reduced daamage while closed

Cons:
- Laser weapons deal reduced damage at distance (50% at maximum range)
- Only one of its weapons fires at the maximum range
- Outranged by Pulsars, T2 popup artillery, and T2 long-range artillery like Arbiters, Diplomats, and Negotiators
- Very expensive
- Must be closed manually to protect from artillery
- Prime target for tactical missiles

#### Moray / Lamprey Advanced Torpedo Launcher

The advanced torpedo launcher sees little use outside of dedicated naval maps or extended T2 naval battles. Its impressive range and anti-underwater torpedos make it especially good against submarines.

Pros:
- Very effective vs ducks and submarines
- Reliably outranged only by missile cruisers and flagships
- Some AoE damage

Cons:
- Low sonar range, requires sonar station nearby to maximize effectiveness

#### Arbalest / Birdshot Anti-Air Flak

Flak cannons are extremely effective against enemy air attacks.

Pros:
- Highest anti-air DPS in the game
- Great AoE damage, shreds fighters and bombers alike

Cons:
- Low range for such an expensive AA unit
- Must be build somewhat in front of base to kill bombers before they release their bombs

#### Mercury / Screamer Long Range Anti-Air

LRAA is a potent secondary weapon against bombers or fighter walls.

Pros:
- Highest range anti-air in the game
- Very high AoE
- Great for denying fighter walls, sniping nuclear bombers, or killing T2 bombers with splash damage

Cons:
- Countered by spacing out bombers
- Requires time to load missiles (1 every 13 seconds), and can only stock 5 missiles at once
- Missiles require energy to build
- Missiles can be baited out by scout planes, requiring micro to preserve shots

#### Catalyst

Less of a defensive structure, the Catalyst tactical missile launcher can turn an advantage into a win given the right opportunity.

Pros:
- Great range can threaten enemy bases or defensive lines
- Outranges all defenses, including Pulsar
- Difficult to dislodge from high ground
- Can deny a very large area from defenses

Cons:
- Range isn't high enough to threaten bases without getting uncomfortably close
- Missiles cost metal to reload and take a long time to load

#### Paralyzer

Less of a defensive structure, the Paralyzer can create opportunities from halfway across the map.

Pros:
- Excellent range, can threaten enemy bases or defensive lines
- Outranges all defenses, including Pulsar
- Outranges Catalyst
- Can stun anti-nukes

Cons:
- Deals no damage
- Missiles cost metal to reload and take a long time to load

#### Basilica / Basilisk Long Range Plasma Cannon

Also known as LRPC, these siege weapons have extremely high range and present a significant threat to your opponent's base.

Pros:
- Extremely high range

Cons:
- Costs energy to fire
- Opponent can shield themselves with plasma deflectors, although these require energy upkeep
- Very low accuracy, often requiring big targets or multiple shots

#### Calamity / Ragnarok

These are literally game-ending siege weapons, requiring an extraordinary investment in time and resources, but usually winning the game if finished.

Pros:
- Extremely high DPS that is almost impossible to counter with shields
- Extremely high range that can threaten even backline bases on some maps

Cons:
- The most expensive unit in the game, requiring staggering amounts of resources to finish
- Highest priority target for the enemy, requiring even more resources to defend it even while constructing
- Consumes energy at an alarming rate, requiring up to 8 Advanced Fusion Reactors to reach its full potential
