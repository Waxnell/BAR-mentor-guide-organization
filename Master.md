# Welcome to BAR! 
This sheet is meant to help give direction in your learning process so that you can easily go down and check to make sure you understand these concepts, before continuing deeper, to both solidify your foundation as a player, and also save you time by learning in a more efficient way.

## The Prime Directive, or how to play BAR
First and foremost, understanding the core idea of how the game is played, and what your major goals and choices revolve around, is absolutely essential in making the learning process more efficient, and helping you to become the best player you can be.

To that effect, we have the 'prime directive'. This is, so to speak, the guiding hand behind all of our strategies, tactics, and skills that you will learn on this list, and the 'goal' you are trying to achieve by enacting these things. All the choices you make, and practice you put into these concepts will feed into this, and as a result, into having more fun, and winning more games :)

### Map Control
This game is built around map control. By controlling more of the map, you control more resources, and more information. By gaining this advantage, you gain access to a variety of tactics that will checkmate your opponents(s), and put you into a winning position. 

The sheer chasm of difference in how fast resources are collected from MEXs, versus building Energy production and converters, can rarely be overstated. Controlling more of the map puts you at a completely insurmountable income advantage when met directly. 

This leads to the myriad of strategies to take, defend, and sabotage your opponent, instead of just trying to 'not lose'. Take, hold, and use the space and mexs on the map, and victory shall follow close at hand."
