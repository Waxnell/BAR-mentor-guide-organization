# Efficient Energy Production

Different types of energy are more/less efficient on different maps. Some maps have high wind while others have no wind. Some maps have good tidal power, others don't. Here, we'll go over when it makes sense to produce one type of energy over another.

## Types of Energy Production

### T1 Energy Production
- [Wind Turbine](https://www.beyondallreason.info/unit/armwin)
	> - Windspeed is dynamic, changing throughout the match. It displayed next to the energy bar at the top
   	> - Different maps have different parameters for wind speed
  	> - Relatively cheap, but needs to be mass produced, thus costing a lot of build time
  	> - *Armada has a significantlly cheaper version*
- [Solar Collector](https://www.beyondallreason.info/unit/armwin)
	> - Always produce 20 energy/sec
   	> - Extremely metal expensive but costs no energy
   	> - *Cortex has the cheaper version*
- [Tidal Generator](https://www.beyondallreason.info/unit/armwin)
	> - Tide varies depending on the map and is displayed next to windspeed
   	> - Can only be placed in deeper water
  	> - *Cortex has the cheaper version*

- [Advanced Solar](https://www.beyondallreason.info/unit/armwin)
	> - Always produce 75 energy/sec
   	> - Relatively expensive, but more efficient than basic solars
  	> - *Cortex has the slighter cheaper version*
- [Geothermal Powerplant](https://www.beyondallreason.info/unit/armwin)
	> - Always produce 300 energy/sec
 	> - Rather expensive, especially on energy
   	> - Can only be placed on geothermal vents
    > - *Cortex has the cheaper version*

### T2 Energy Production
- Fusion
- Advanced Geothermal
- Advanced Fusion
- Prude / Cerberus

### Some Units Produce Energy Too

While you do not want to rely on units to produce the bulk of your energy needs, some of them do produce a significant amount
These Include:
  - Constructors
  - Aircraft Carriers
